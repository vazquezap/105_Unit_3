# Overview
## NC Health Data
This repository contians instructions and resources for creating and using North Carolina health data.

The repository contains an instructional Python notebook **(NC_health_data.ipynb)**, the original *.csv* file **(CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv)** for retrieval, and additional resources such as **NC_subset.csv**, **NC_subset_health.csv**, and visualizations, in addition to this **README.md** file.

The original dataset in this repository **(CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv)** has been retreived from Professor Gotzler's English 105 course through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

# Why North Carolina? 
This repository specifically focuses on data from North Carolina. The **purpose** of looking at the data from North Carolina is to find a correlation, if any, among different variables relating to healthcare costs (i.e. uemployment, uninsured individuals, median household income). Although each variable may potentiually have a relationship to healthcare costs, this does not mean that there *must* be some type of correlation. For instance, unemployment rates and median household income for each county might not relate to each other, but it is important to consider, which is why these variables are included in the dataset. 

# What Can this Data Show?
Through analysis of this data, individuals may generate a deeper understanding of issues relating to healthcare costs. Categorical variables such as unemployment, uninsured children and adults, and median household income are useful components in understadning correlations within the dataset.

This dataset is available to the public, but also policy makers, researchers, and educators who may be intersted in reviewing this data as means to potentially address issues relating to healthcare costs.


# Vizualizing NC Data

***NC_subset_health contains data which may be valuable for vizualization.*** 

## Potential Vizualizations: Maps
The following vizualization shows the percent of uninsured individuals in North Carolina by county, in 2015.

### Tip For Data Vizualization
A simple way to produce data vizualizations using **NC_subset.csv** or **NC_subset_health.csv** is to change the numberical values from decimals to percentages.
