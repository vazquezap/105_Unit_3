# Unit_3_Data_Repository
This repository contians instructions and resources for creating and using North Carolina health data.

This repository consists of an instructional Python notebook and the original .csv file of the County Health Data for retrieval.
The original data in this repository has been retreived from Professor Gotzler's English 105 course through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

This repository specifically utilizes data from North Carolina. The purpose of looking at the data from North Carolina is to find a correlation between different variables relating to healthcare costs (i.e. uemployment, uninsured individuals, median household income). The North Carolina dataset reperesents data from various counties across the state in order to provide a larger perspective of data. 
Potential outcomes for this data set include finding correltation between high helthcare costs and the amount of people who do not seek medical care. Categorical variables such as unemployment, uninsured children and adults, and median household income are useful components in understadning correlations within the dataset.
This dataset is available to the general public, but also policy makers, researchers, and educators who may be intersted in reviewing this data as means to potentially address issues relating to healthcare costs.
