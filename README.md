# Unit_3_Data_Repository
This repository contians instructions and resources for creating and using North Carolina health data.

This repository consists of an instructional Python notebook and the original .csv file (CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) for retrieval.
The original data in this repository has been retreived from Professor Gotzler's English 105 course through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

This repository specifically utilizes data from North Carolina. The purpose of looking at the data from North Carolina is to find a correlation, if any, among different variables relating to healthcare costs (i.e. uemployment, uninsured individuals, median household income). The North Carolina dataset reperesents data from various counties across the state.

Potential outcomes for this data set relate to finding correlations between different variables relating to high healthcare costs. Categorical variables such as unemployment, uninsured children and adults, and median household income are useful components in understadning correlations within the dataset.

This dataset is available to the public, but also policy makers, researchers, and educators who may be intersted in reviewing this data as means to potentially address issues relating to healthcare costs.


# Vizualizing NC Data
The NC Public Health data demonstrates valuable data where a vizualization may be used.

The following vizualization shows the percent of uninsured individuals in North Carolina by county, in 2015.

This visualization takes the data a step forward and analyzes two variables: "Uninsured" and "Could not see a doctor due to cost."
